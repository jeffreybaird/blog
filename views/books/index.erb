<h1>Books</h1>

<p>I got this idea from <%= link_to("https://sivers.org/book", "Derek Sivers") %>. I've tried to keep track of my reading in the past but never publically. So, for 2016 I commit to put every book I read up here with a <%= link_to("/books/rating","rating") %> and a short review, summary or some notes. Eventually I'll come up with some sorting mechanism.</p>

<ol>


<li> <%= link_to("/books/how_about_never", "How About Neverâ€”Is Never Good for You?: My Life in Cartoons") %></li>
<li> <%= link_to("/books/attack_of_the_clones", "Attack of the Clones") %></li>
<li><%= link_to("/books/the_gifts_of_imperfection", "The Gifts of Imperfection: Let Go of Who You Think You&#39;re Supposed to Be and Embrace Who You Are") %></li>
</ol>
<%= footer %>
