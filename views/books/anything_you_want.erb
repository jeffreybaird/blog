<p>I highlighted 41 passages in this book, which only has 88 pages. It felt like Derek was giving me personal advice on how to start my next business.</p>

<p>My big takeaways:</p>

<ul>
	<li>It is okay for profit to not be your primary motivation when you donâ€™t have investors. </li>
	<li>The best way to grow is to focus completely on your customers.</li>
	<li>Through automation and delegation, work hard to make yourself unnessecary to your business.</li>
</ul>

<p>If you are interested in starting a business but find yourself questioning conventional startup wisdom, you will enjoy this book. </p>
