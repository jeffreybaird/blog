<p> I picked this book up to get a better idea of how the mortgage industry worked before I started at Roostify. The book reads like an advertisement for the author. Each chapter follows this general format:</p>

<ol>
	<li>Introduce some terms.</li>
	<li>Introduce a concept.</li>
	<li>Talk about all the ways a bad actor will try to take advantage of you or how it can go wrong.</li>
	<li>Describe how much better she is than everyone else at handling this concept.</li>
	<li>Tell a story about how awesome she was at handling something.</li>
</ol>

<p>In general, the book is useful for getting my head around just how complex the mortgage industry is. However, it is out of date as most of the book focuses on Truth-in-Lending regulations which have been superseded by TRID (TILA and RESPA Integrated Disclosure).</p>

<p>If you are a consumer looking to get a loan, I would recommend waiting for a book that covers the new regulations. If you canâ€™t wait, this book does provide some good checklists on what you should be asking your lender and what documents you will need.</p>
